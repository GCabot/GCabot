- 👋 Hi, I’m @GCabot, Post-Doctoral researcher in Antibiotic Resistance and Pathogeny of Bacterial Infections Lab (ARPBIG-IDISBA; https://arpbigidisba.com/) of Sanitary Research Institute of Balearic Islands (IdISBa - Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de les Illes Balears; http://www.idisba.es/en)
- 👀 I’m interested in Whole-Genome Sequencing data analysis, bioinformatic treatment of data. But also I'm interested in lab-automation using the Opentrons OT-2 robot or designing and building my own solutions combining 3D printing, electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding languages as Python or Arduino, 3D modelling and 3D printing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Bioinformatic Data Analysis tools development, and software/hardware developing.
- 📫 To reach me, please email me at gabriel.cabot(at)ssib.es, gcabot.ssib(at)gmail.com
- I'm also interested in 3D modelling and printing, (conventional and astro)photography and many others hobbies, you could find them at https://gacame.wordpress.com/
